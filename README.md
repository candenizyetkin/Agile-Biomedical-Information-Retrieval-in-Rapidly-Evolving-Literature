# Agile-Information-Retrieval-Using-Few-Shot-and-Zero-Shot-Prompt-Engineering
This is the repository for CENG543 Term Project (25'-26') by Can Deniz Yetkin

This repository contains the work for the CENG543 final term research project. The project's objective is to investigate the effectiveness of general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) as an agile and cost-effective alternative for information retrieval in the rapidly evolving field of biomedical literature.

Traditional dense retrievers are powerful but static. In a field like biomedicine, where new research is published daily, keeping these models current requires continuous, costly retraining.

This project asks the following core research question:

Can a general-purpose Large Language Model (LLM), guided by careful prompt engineering (zero-shot & few-shot), match the ranking and retrieval accuracy of a specialized, trained DPR model on a domain-specific biomedical dataset like PubMedQA? 

This study aims to assess the potential of a more flexible, powerful, and "agile" alternative for domain-specific information retrieval.
